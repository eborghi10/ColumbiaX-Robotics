# CSMM.103x | Project 1

In this assignment you are tasked with writing a **node that subscribes to a topic and publishes to another**. Your code will subscribe to a topic called _'two_ints'_, on which a custom message containing two integers can be broadcast. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the message format of this topic (have a look at the TwoInts.msg in the msg directory). Those two integers are to be added and the result published to topic 'sum' as an Int16.
